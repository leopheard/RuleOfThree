<a href="kodi.tv">KODI<a> / XBMC / Firestick addon for the <a href="https://www.ruleofthreepod.com">Rule Of Three</a> podcast.<br>

Comedy writers Jason Hazeley and Joel Morris talk to people who make comedy about something funny that they love. Guests pick a TV show, a film, a book, an album or a comic that means something to them. Maybe we find out something about how comedy works. Maybe there's just a lot of giggling.<br>
